# NestJS Application Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running your NestJS application locally using MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- MongoDB (installed and running locally or accessible remotely)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Create an environment file:**

   Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project.

   ```plaintext
   # .env file

   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   ```

   Replace `<your-mongodb-uri>` with the URI of your MongoDB database. If your MongoDB instance requires authentication, make sure to include the username and password in the URI.


## Running the Application

To start your NestJS application locally:

```bash
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
```

This command starts the application in development mode. The application will watch for file changes and restart automatically.

## Accessing the Application

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000` (assuming your application is configured to run on port 3000).

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your MongoDB server is running and accessible.
- Adjust any other configuration settings (e.g., port number, additional environment variables) as needed for your application.
