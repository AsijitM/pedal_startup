Certainly! Here's a more polished version of the instruction to clone the repository and set up both frontend and backend locally, with information about the deployed application:

# Pedal Startup Application

Welcome to the Pedal Startup application repository. This repository contains both the frontend (FE) and backend (BE) components of the Pedal Startup application.

## Deployed Application

The complete application is deployed and accessible at [Pedal Assignment Hosted](https://pedal-startup.vercel.app/).

- **Backend** is deployed on Render.
- **Frontend** is deployed on Vercel.

## Local Setup Instructions

To run the Pedal Startup application locally, follow the setup instructions in their respective folders:

### Frontend (FE)

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to set up and run the frontend locally.

This README.md provides a clear and organized guide for anyone cloning the repository to set up and run both the frontend and backend components locally, as well as information about the deployed application. Adjust folder names (`frontend` and `backend`) and links as per your actual project structure and deployment locations.
